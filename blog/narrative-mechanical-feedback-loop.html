            <h1>On the narrative-mechanical loop in TTRPGs</h1>
            <p>To me the link between narrative and game mechanics, and how they recursively impact each other is the backbone of what makes TTRPGs great. </p>
            <p>You start with a set of standardised and known rules to help enforce a desired narrative, then as the game progresses the mechanics can evolve to 
            reflect new themes and ideas. For example as the hero's learn of coming threat of the Old Ones a Darkening mechanic can be added to represent the corruption
            and dread spreading over the lands. Lets say that at each in game dawn a player rolls a d6 and on a 1 the Darkening increases by one step. These mechanics now directly effect
            the narrative of the world. If the players are unlucky they might roll a 1 three days in a row as the Darkening rushes over the land, drowning the sun in a black fog. Now
            we have the opportunity to introduce new mechanics!</p>
            <p>What I'm trying to say is that <strong>mechanics should evolve alongside the narrative.</strong></p>
            <p>To me that means that you shouldn't be afraid to throw out anything and everything that doesn't feel right. If the god of fate is imprisoned by the Sentinel of Order why not try changing your d20 resolution system to 2d10. When the threads of magic get devoured by demons spells are now roll to cast and implode on a critical failure.</p>
            <p>Go crazy.</p>
