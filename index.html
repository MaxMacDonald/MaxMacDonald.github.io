            <h1>How I cut GTA Online loading times by 70%</h1>
            <p class="date">TOST 2021-02-28</p>

        <main>
            <p><strong>GTA Online.</strong> <em>Infamous</em> for its slow loading times. Having picked up the game again to finish some of the newer heists I was <em>shocked (/s)</em> to discover that it still loads just as slow as the day it was released 7 years ago.</p>
            <p>It was time. Time to get to the bottom of this.</p>
            
            <h2>#Recon</h2>
            <p>First I wanted to check if someone had already solved this problem. Most of the results I found pointed towards anecdota about <em>how the game is so sophisticated</em> that it needs to load so long, stories on how the <em>p2p network architecture</em> is rubbish (not saying that it isn’t), some elaborate ways of <em>loading into story mode and a solo session after that</em> and a couple of mods that allowed skipping the startup R* logo video. Some more reading told me we could save a whopping 10-30 seconds with these combined!</p>
            <p>Meanwhile on my PC…</p>
            
            <h2>#Benchmark</h2>
            <div class="benchmark">
                <p><strong>Story mode load time:</strong> ~1m 10s</p>
